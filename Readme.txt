This project contians the source code for Analysis and Simulaton of moving sensor paradaigm for HVAC Control

Background:
Please refer to: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8825986

Files introduction:
1. Model: contain the thermal model of system and stochastic model of movement of system
2. Analysis: Analyze moment stabiliy and expected value of given range of PID control gains (Kp,Kd,Ki) and illustrate stability region
3. Simulation: Simple impelementation of stochastic model for 36 hours
4. FindOptimal, find the optimal control gains using optimizer function
